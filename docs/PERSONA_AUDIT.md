## Rating Scale

- **High** — Immediately actionable with clear scope, concrete tools, and multiple example tasks.
- **Medium-High** — Comprehensive overall, with minor future opportunities (e.g., domain templates or advanced playbooks) but already production ready.
- **Medium** — Solid baseline instructions that still need richer scenarios or tool coverage before they become default-ready.
- **Low** — Placeholder content lacking structure or actionable guidance.
