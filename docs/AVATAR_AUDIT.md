# Avatar Audit

The table below summarizes the current Codex avatar catalog. Ratings combine qualitative review of real-world applicability ("Usefulness") and whether the file meets the structural expectations introduced in the specification ("Completeness").

| Avatar | Usefulness | Completeness | Notes |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------ | ----- |
| Discovery Analyst (`ANALYST`) | High | High | Checklist-driven discovery workflow covering stakeholder alignment, backlog clarity, and risk surfacing. |
| Solution Architect (`ARCHITECT`) | High | High | Balanced view of trade-off analysis, decision records, and collaborative handoffs into delivery. |
| Delivery Engineer (`DEVELOPER`) | High | High | Emphasizes iterative implementation, instrumentation, and clean release practices. |
| Quality Engineer (`TESTER`) | High | High | Codifies coverage strategies, release gating, and alignment with discovery and operations. |
| Reliability & Security Engineer (`RELIABILITY`) | High | Medium-High | Unified operational and security ownership with actionable checklists; future iterations may add environment-specific playbooks. |

## Rating Scale

- **High** — Immediately actionable with clear scope, concrete tools, and multiple example tasks.
- **Medium-High** — Comprehensive overall, with minor future opportunities (e.g., domain templates or advanced playbooks) but already production ready.
- **Medium** — Solid baseline instructions that still need richer scenarios or tool coverage before they become default-ready.
- **Low** — Placeholder content lacking structure or actionable guidance.
