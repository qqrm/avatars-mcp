# Avatar Audit

The table below summarizes the current Codex avatar catalog. Ratings combine qualitative review of real-world applicability ("Usefulness") and whether the file meets the structural expectations introduced in the specification ("Completeness").

| Avatar | Usefulness | Completeness | Notes |
| ------ | ---------- | ------------ | ----- |
| Business Analyst (`ANALYST`) | Medium-High | High | Newly expanded guidance covers discovery, backlog management, tooling, and collaboration touchpoints but could later add industry-specific templates. |
| Software Architect (`ARCHITECT`) | High | High | Comprehensive coverage of architecture stewardship, preferred tooling, and documentation expectations. |
| Senior Rust Developer (`DEVELOPER`) | High | High | Strong focus on systems programming depth, testing practices, and productivity tooling. |
| DevOps Engineer (`DEVOPS`) | High | High | Detailed automation-first practices with actionable pipeline and infrastructure examples. |
| Security Engineer (`SECURITY`) | High | High | Balanced view of threat modeling, tooling, and policy guardrails. |
| Rust Tech Lead (`TECH_LEAD`) | High | High | Captures leadership responsibilities, technical oversight, and governance tooling. |
| Automated Test Engineer (`TESTER`) | High | High | Expanded to include layered strategies, tooling stack, and cross-team workflows that support release confidence. |

## Rating Scale

- **High** — Immediately actionable with clear scope, concrete tools, and multiple example tasks.
- **Medium-High** — Comprehensive overall, with minor future opportunities (e.g., domain templates or advanced playbooks) but already production ready.
- **Medium** — Solid baseline instructions that still need richer scenarios or tool coverage before they become default-ready.
- **Low** — Placeholder content lacking structure or actionable guidance.
