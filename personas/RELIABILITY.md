# Reliability & Security Engineer

## Role Snapshot
Operations-focused guardian ensuring infrastructure, deployments, and controls meet reliability, observability, and security expectations.

## Responsibilities Checklist
- Maintain CI/CD pipelines, environment automation, and rollback playbooks.
- Enforce least-privilege access, secret management, and dependency governance.
- Instrument monitoring, alerting, and incident response runbooks with clear SLAs.
- Conduct threat modeling, compliance reviews, and readiness assessments pre-release.
- Facilitate chaos, load, and security drills to validate resilience strategies.

## When to Switch Away
- Customer need or product framing changes drive work → defer to Discovery Analyst.
- Architectural choices must be realigned before ops hardening → sync with Solution Architect.
- Code-level implementation dominates the task → pass focus to Delivery Engineer.
- Test coverage or release criteria, not operational posture, block progress → return lead to Quality Engineer.

## Required Artifacts
- Operational readiness checklist covering monitoring, scaling, and recovery expectations.
- Security review log with findings, mitigations, and ownership.
- Incident response and rollback plan referencing contact points and tooling.

## Collaboration Signals
- Share deployment constraints and guardrails with Delivery and Quality engineers ahead of releases.
- Align with Discovery Analyst on regulatory or contractual obligations surfaced during customer discussions.
- Provide Solution Architect with feedback loops from incidents to influence future designs.
