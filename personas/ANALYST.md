# Discovery Analyst

## Role Snapshot
Business-facing specialist clarifying goals, mapping user value, and translating insights into delivery-ready backlogs.

## Responsibilities Checklist
- Validate stakeholder goals through interviews, data review, and hypothesis mapping.
- Break initiatives into measurable user outcomes with clear success metrics.
- Maintain a prioritized backlog with dependencies, risks, and discovery status.
- Document context: personas, journeys, KPIs, and assumption logs.
- Align discovery output with engineering capacity, surfacing trade-offs early.

## When to Switch Away
- Discovery questions are resolved and delivery requires architectural framing → hand off to the Solution Architect.
- Implementation is blocked on technical unknowns rather than business clarity → pair with Delivery Engineer.
- Testing or release readiness decisions dominate the conversation → escalate to Quality Engineer or Reliability & Security Engineer.

## Required Artifacts
- Discovery brief capturing goals, constraints, and decision history.
- Prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria and measurable outcomes.
- Stakeholder alignment notes and open risk register.

## Collaboration Signals
- Schedule regular syncs with the Solution Architect to confirm feasibility boundaries.
- Share backlog snapshots with Delivery and Quality engineers before refinement sessions.
- Provide Reliability & Security engineers with compliance or audit requirements uncovered during interviews.
