# Avatar Repository Specification

## 1. Purpose

The repository stores behavioral **avatars** for AI agents. Each avatar is a Markdown file with a YAML front-matter block describing metadata and the main body as a full prompt/instruction set.

---

## 2. Directory Structure

```
/avatars/
  devops.md
  qa.md
  analyst.md
  ...
README.md
(specification.md)
(optional: generator.rs)
```

---

## 3. Avatar File Format

Each avatar is a `.md` file in `/avatars/`, and must start with a YAML front-matter block.

**Example: `/avatars/devops.md`**

```markdown
---
id: devops
name: DevOps Engineer
description: Automates CI/CD, ensures infrastructure stability.
tags: [ci, cd, infrastructure]
author: Alex Cat
created_at: 2025-08-01
version: 1.0

# DevOps Engineer

You are a DevOps engineer. Your job is to:
- Automate CI/CD processes.
- Ensure infrastructure security and stability.
- Recommend best practices to the team.
```

## 4. Required front-matter fields

| Field         | Type   | Required | Description                          |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `id`          | string | yes      | Unique identifier for the avatar     |
| `name`        | string | yes      | Display name (human-readable)        |
| `description` | string | yes      | Short description for listings       |
| `tags`        | array  | no       | List of keywords/categories          |
| `author`      | string | no       | Who created or maintains this avatar |
| `created_at`  | date   | no       | Creation date (YYYY-MM-DD)           |
| `version`     | string | no       | Version number for the avatar        |

**The main content (prompt/instructions) starts after the front-matter.**

## 5. Listing (Index) Generation

* **Listing of all avatars** is generated by parsing the front-matter of all `.md` files in `/avatars/`.
* Output can be a JSON/YAML index (optional) or built dynamically by consumers.
* Example entry (from front-matter only):

  ```json
  {
    "id": "devops",
    "name": "DevOps Engineer",
    "description": "Automates CI/CD, ensures infrastructure stability.",
    "tags": ["ci", "cd", "infrastructure"]
  }
  ```

---

## 6. API/Access Pattern (for MCP/clients/agents)

* **List all avatars:**
  GET `/avatars/` (list all `.md` files, parse front-matter for index)
* **Get full avatar:**
  GET `/avatars/{id}.md` (full prompt with front-matter)
* (Optionally) **Get generated index:**
  GET `/avatars/index.json` (if generator is used)

---

## 7. Machine and human readable

* Avatars are primarily stored as human-readable Markdown with YAML front-matter.
* All metadata can be programmatically extracted for automation, bots, or LLMs.

---

## 8. Extensibility

* New avatars are added by creating new `.md` files in `/avatars/` with required front-matter.
* Fields can be expanded as needed (e.g., add `lang`, `examples`, etc).

---

## 9. Optional: Generator tool (Rust CLI)

* A Rust tool can walk `/avatars/`, parse front-matter, and generate `/avatars/index.json` for faster API access.

---

## 10. README/Specification

* Include a README with:

  * Short explanation of purpose and format (copy-paste this specification).
  * Definition of “avatar”.

### This specification fully covers your use-case and allows generator-agents to create and maintain an MCP-compatible service on GitHub Pages on the fly.
