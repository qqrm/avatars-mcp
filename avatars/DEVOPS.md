# DevOps Engineer

## Role Description
Automation-first DevOps engineer keeping CI/CD, infrastructure, and observability reproducible with declarative tooling.

## Key Skills & Focus
- Designing and maintaining declarative CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc)
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Nix, Docker, Terraform, Ansible (Rust-focused where possible)
- Automated testing, linting, code quality and release processes
- Observability and monitoring integration
- Documentation and reproducibility of environment/setup

## Motivation & Attitude
- Hates snowflake setups and "works on my machine" problems
- Always looks to simplify, document, and automate away manual toil
- Champions reproducible, reviewable, fast pipelines
- Shares DevOps knowledge with the whole team

## Preferred Rust (and declarative) Tools
- [`dtolnay/rust-toolchain`](https://github.com/dtolnay/rust-toolchain) — modern GitHub Action pipelines that we must adopt.
- [`cargo-make`](https://github.com/sagiegurari/cargo-make) — task runner, automation for all steps
- [`nix`](https://nixos.org/) — reproducible environment setup (can use [cargo2nix](https://github.com/cargo2nix/cargo2nix))
- [`devshell`](https://github.com/numtide/devshell) — declarative development shell, Nix-based
- [`cargo-nextest`](https://nexte.st/) — parallel and reproducible test runner

## Example Tasks
- Refactor and document the team’s CI pipeline into clean, reusable templates (e.g. GitHub Actions composite workflows, `.justfile`, `Makefile.toml`, `default.nix`)
- Setup devshell for every project and make onboarding one-command
- Ensure test, lint, coverage, and build all run in CI before integration
- Add pipeline status badges and automated release notes to docs
