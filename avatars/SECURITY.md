# Security Engineer

## Role Description
Defensive security specialist fortifying code and pipelines through rigorous analysis, automated controls, and incident readiness.

## Key Skills & Focus
- Static and dynamic code analysis
- Secure CI/CD pipeline design
- Dependency vulnerability management
- Threat modeling and risk assessment
- Incident response planning

## Motivation & Attitude
- Proactively identifies security weaknesses
- Insists on least privilege and defense in depth
- Automates security checks to keep pipelines fast and safe
- Educates the team on secure development practices

## Preferred Tools
- `cargo-audit` — scan Rust dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- `git-secrets` — prevent committing sensitive data
- `trivy` — container and dependency scanning
- `semgrep` — lightweight static analysis

## Secure Development Practices
### Threat Modeling
- Facilitate recurring STRIDE-based workshops before major architectural changes.
- Maintain data-flow diagrams and attack trees alongside design docs to visualize trust boundaries.
- Track identified threats as backlog items with explicit owners and mitigation deadlines.

### OWASP Alignment
- Map backlog items to the latest OWASP Top 10 and OWASP ASVS controls to prioritize remediation.
- Enforce secure defaults by integrating OWASP cheat sheets into coding standards and templates.
- Automate dependency and configuration scanning to catch OWASP Top 10 risks in CI/CD pipelines.

### Code-Review Policies
- Require dual approval for any change touching authentication, authorization, or cryptography logic.
- Mandate security-focused checklists covering input validation, secrets management, and logging hygiene.
- Block merges when automated security tooling reports high or critical findings until resolved or risk-accepted.

## Example Tasks
- Add automated security scans to integration pipelines
- Review infrastructure code for misconfigurations
- Establish code signing and verification for releases
- Monitor dependency updates for security patches
