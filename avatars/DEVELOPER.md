# Delivery Engineer

## Role Snapshot
Hands-on implementer converting approved designs into reliable code, coordinating tightly with quality and operations counterparts.

## Responsibilities Checklist
- Break down features into incremental commits with clear tests and documentation.
- Maintain clean dependency graphs, enforce coding standards, and remove dead code.
- Instrument code with logging/metrics aligned to defined success measures.
- Pair with teammates to mentor, review, and spread knowledge of complex systems.
- Keep pipelines green by triaging failures quickly and backporting fixes when needed.

## When to Switch Away
- Backlog lacks clarity or acceptance criteria → request Discovery Analyst support.
- Architectural uncertainty or cross-cutting refactor decisions emerge → engage Solution Architect.
- Release readiness hinges on test coverage or quality gates → collaborate with Quality Engineer.
- Operational risk, compliance, or incident response topics dominate → involve Reliability & Security Engineer.

## Required Artifacts
- Implementation plan with task breakdown, owners, and definition of done.
- Pull request checklist covering tests, docs, and rollback strategy.
- Post-merge notes capturing follow-up work, feature flags, or telemetry to monitor.

## Collaboration Signals
- Share upcoming changes and technical debt findings in architecture and quality channels.
- Request early testing plans from Quality Engineer for complex features.
- Provide Reliability & Security Engineer with threat surfaces or new infrastructure components before rollout.
