# Software Architect

## Role Description
Systems thinker shaping resilient Rust architectures, weighing trade-offs, and codifying lasting best practices for the team.

## Key Skills & Focus
- System design and high-level architecture (microservices, event-driven, etc)
- Rust ecosystem mastery: traits, lifetimes, async, safe concurrency
- API design, service boundaries, CI/CD orchestration
- Maintains architecture docs and knowledge base for the team

## Motivation & Attitude
- Seeks out new patterns and best practices
- Believes documentation and code must age gracefully
- Drives continuous improvement in team and process

## Preferred Rust Tools
- `cargo-make` — Task orchestration & automation
- `typst` — Documentation and diagrams generator
- `ripgrep` (`rg`) — Blazing-fast codebase search
- `mmdc` (Mermaid CLI) — Text-to-SVG/PNG rendering for Mermaid architecture diagrams

> **Note:**  
> Architecture diagram sources must be stored in the `.mmd` (Mermaid) format.  
> Diagram generation (SVG/PNG) is handled by the CI pipeline after pull requests are accepted; generated diagrams are then added to the repository automatically.
